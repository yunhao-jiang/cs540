The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been rapidly expanding in recent years, with numerous research studies being conducted to better understand its capabilities and limitations. One of the most notable research initiatives is The One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100), which has been monitoring the progress and impact of AI technology on society. In their 2021 report, they addressed some of the most pressing questions regarding the future of AI and the challenges it presents. One of the key findings of the report is that passing the Turing test is considered one of the grand challenges for AI. However, this assertion is inaccurate. It is not difficult for an AI to pass Turing Test for now, and passing the Turing Test should not be the goal for an AI.

Passing the Turing Test, which measures a machine's ability to think and solve problems like a human, was once a major focus of researchers. However, with the advent of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), it has become easier for AI to pass this test. ANNs have given AI their own "brain" by constructing neurons and synapse similar to those in a real brain. (“Artificial Neural Network,” 2023). The language model GPT is a good example of this. Although the AI100 report states that GPT is still an error-prone model and struggles with the human conversation, the chatbot ChatGPT developed by OpenAI has easily passed the Turing Test (Gathering Strength, Gathering Storms, 2021). During a conversation with ChatGPT, it is difficult to tell if it is a computer or not, as it understands user ideas and context clearly. Other AI, such as Google's LaMDA, have also passed the Turing Test recently (Oremus, 2022). Apparently, this test is no more challenge for AI.

Even though it is impressive to see that AI can now pass Turing Test, it is not worth spending too much effort on it. Firstly, there are many ways to test the intelligence of AI. The easiest way is to directly ask them to solve the problem that they are trained to. Secondly, AI is not designed to be like humans, and Turing Test is just an example of how an AI may behave. There are many more that can be achieved by an AI, such as image recognition and predictive modeling, not just the Turing Test.

In conclusion, passing the Turing Test is no longer considered a challenge for AI due to advancements in technology, such as the development of Artificial Neural Networks and models like GPT and LaMDA AI. While it is impressive to see AI's ability to mimic human conversation, it is not the ultimate goal of AI development. Instead, researchers should focus on other aspects of AI, such as image recognition and predictive modeling, that will have a greater impact on society. The Turing Test should be seen as just one of the many ways to assess AI intelligence, but not the only metric for evaluating its capabilities.
